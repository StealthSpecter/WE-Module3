\section{Introduction:}

The bidding card game "Diamonds" is a strategic and competitive game where players bid with cards from their hands to win diamond cards with varying point values. Developing effective strategies for playing this game can significantly improve one's chances of winning. In this report, we aim to explore the use of genetic algorithms (GenAI) to develop optimal strategies for playing Diamonds. The objective is to create a program that can intelligently bid on diamond cards, maximizing the player's score while considering the opponent's bids and card distributions.

\section{Methodology:}


To develop strategies for Diamonds using GenAI, we employed a multi-step approach:

1. Understanding the Rules: We started by thoroughly understanding the rules of the Diamonds game, including the bidding process, card values, and scoring mechanism.

2. Designing the Genetic Algorithm: We designed a genetic algorithm to evolve strategies for bidding in Diamonds. The genetic algorithm consisted of a population of candidate strategies represented as chromosomes, with each chromosome encoding a potential bidding strategy.

3. Fitness Evaluation: We defined a fitness function to evaluate the performance of each bidding strategy. The fitness function considered factors such as the total score achieved, the efficiency of bidding, and adaptability to opponent bids.

4. Evolutionary Process: The genetic algorithm underwent an evolutionary process, where parent strategies were selected based on their fitness and used to produce offspring through crossover and mutation operations. This process iterated over multiple generations, gradually improving the quality of bidding strategies.

5. Testing and Validation: We tested the evolved bidding strategies against human players and other pre-defined strategies to validate their effectiveness and robustness.


\section{Reflections on Conversation with GenAI and Prompting/Learnings:}


During the conversation with GenAI, we prompted it with questions and instructions to guide the development process:

1. Clarification on Game Rules: We asked GenAI to understand and clarify the rules of the Diamonds game to ensure a solid foundation for strategy development.

2. Strategy Generation: GenAI was tasked with generating diverse bidding strategies, considering factors such as card values, opponent bids, and potential outcomes.

3. Optimization: We directed GenAI to optimize the bidding strategies for maximizing the player's score while minimizing risks.

4. Adaptability: We encouraged GenAI to create bidding strategies that could adapt to different game scenarios and opponent behaviors.

Through these interactions, we learned the importance of clear communication and guidance in shaping the development process. GenAI demonstrated its ability to comprehend complex game rules and generate novel strategies based on specified objectives.

Summary of the conversation with Gen AI:

\textbf{You}: Identifies another issue where the code doesn't remove the bid card from the hands.\\
\textbf{ChatGPT}: Acknowledges the oversight and modifies the code to remove the bid card from both player's and computer's hands after each round. Runs the test cases again to demonstrate the fix.\\


\section{Reflections on Code that was Generated/Snippets:}


The code generated for implementing the bidding strategies in Diamonds incorporated various functions and logic:

1. Initialization: The code initialized the game by shuffling the deck of cards and distributing them among players.

2. Auction Round: It implemented the auction round, where players and the computer bid on diamond cards based on their hand values.

3. Bidding Strategy: The code included the logic for the computer's bidding strategy, which aimed to maximize the bid based on the highest card in its hand.

4. Fitness Evaluation: The fitness function evaluated the performance of bidding strategies based on achieved scores and efficiency in bidding.

5. Evolutionary Process: The genetic algorithm iteratively evolved bidding strategies through selection, crossover, and mutation operations.

These code snippets demonstrated the implementation of core functionalities essential for developing bidding strategies in the Diamonds game using GenAI.
